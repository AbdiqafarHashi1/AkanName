    <h1>Akan Name Generator</h1>
    <img src="CSS/Ghana.png" alt="">
    <p>Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries such as Togo,
         Ivory Coast and Ghana. ... These Akan names signify the day one is born. According
          to Akan tradition, each child is born with a name associated to their soul.
           The day the child is born is therefore determined by the soul.</p>
